  <div class="bio">
    <p>My interest in the web dates back to the late ‘nineties hacking around with HTML and CGI. A career in commodities and finance got in the way but never dissuaded my curiosity. From writing custom spreadsheet applications for the dissemination of options quotes to project-owner roles in matching engines and other sophisticated trading applications, I’ve always kept a hand in the technologies of the web.</p>
    <p>With the advent of coding schools, in particular <a class="text-color" href="http:///devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, I made the decision to leave commodities and dive into the web as a career. After several months of prep work and an arduous 100+ days in the Chicago classrooms of <a class="text-color" href="http:///devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, I’m ready to begin that journey.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="projects">
    <p>Below are a couple of recent projects of which I was a part while at <a class="text-color" href="http:///devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp.</a></p>
    <div class="manterest">
      <a class="text-color" href="http://manterest.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">

      <p><a class="text-color" href="http://manterest.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Manterest</a> is a takeoff on Pinterest. Our four person team completed this project in four days. See the code at <a class="text-color" href="https://github.com/seanot/manterest" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Technologies used included Rails 4.0.0, jQuery, Masonry, and Twitter Bootstrap. My primary areas of involvement were writing models and migrations, testing models, working with Masonry to provide the tiled effect of the photographs, and deploying the site on Heroku.</p>

    <div class="own-your-stuff">
      <img src="OwnYourStuff.png" width="60%">
      <p>Own Your Stuff was an eight-day final project taken on by four of us completing our studies at <a class="text-color" href="http:///devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>. The original vision for this project was for individuals to be able to proactively take physical possession of the intellectual property that they create and post on the web. Be it podcasts, vidcasts, blogs, videos, or music, creators are at the whim of content hosts who collectively have a checkered history of going out of business and making content unavailable for audiences as well as creators.  With just eight days to complete our project, we chose podcasts as our target.</p>
      <p>The app takes a podcast feed url as its input and downloads any and all episodes not previously archived by our site. Metadata is parsed from each episode and cataloged in our database while the mp3 file is uploaded to Dropbox. The end result is the collection of podcasts archived on the creator’s own hard drive in a neat and orderly file structure along with an HTML document also on the user’s hard drive showing exactly what is stored where.</p>
      <p>See the code at <a class="text-color" href="https://github.com/seanot/OwnMyContent" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Technologies used included Rails 4.0.0, OmniAuth, Dropbox SDK, Sidekiq, Redis, feedzirra, ruby-mp3info, Compass, and Sass. My primary involvement included work on content downloading and storage, parsing and cataloging of metadata, testing, and deploying the site on Heroku.</p>
