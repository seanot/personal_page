I am a web developer with a long term background in trading and investment banking. I work for Phoenix Web Group, a firm that specializes in software applications for commodity trading and agriculture. At work, we live in the .net world. At home, the open source world is where I am most comfortable.

This is my personal site and blog and I've chosen to use Jekyll to serve up pages and posts mainly because I wanted to play with Jekyll. For now, I'm using the base Jekyll theme with the intention of modifying things once I am comfortable with the mechanics of the framework.
